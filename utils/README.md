# Utils

Utils is a collection of tools, snippets, scripts that were useful at any time and I might want to use again.


- [pastebin from terminal](https://gist.github.com/jonguenther/e43977be33827ed45bc5b32a394cdf65): simple script to paste to pastebin.
- [termbin](https://www.termbin.com): simple bin for easy terminal use with some limitation to the size.
